# Shadcn UI Vue

Vue port of shadcn-ui.
This project is in active development by [radix vue](github.com/radix-vue/radix-vue) team. We are working on this while porting radix to vue, simultaneously.

We welcome contributors to both [radix vue](github.com/radix-vue/radix-vue) and [shadcn vue](github.com/radix-vue/shadcn-vue). We are actively looking someone that can lead the shadcn vue project based on radix-vue. Please [join our discord](https://discord.gg/dpf7BZY3) and we will get you up and running with the project, lets build them together!

If you want to get notified when we release the initial version, please give it a star! Hopefully we will get them done by this month!

Sincerely, radix-vue team.
